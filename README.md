# GroupeesHumanoidsBundleNamingHelper
The latest Groupees comic bundle names their files according to ISBN and not Title. This little tool renames your Humanoids comics so you don't have to do it by hand, which is handy especially if you download them all at once.

Compile and then run the executable in the directory where all your .cbz or .pdf files live.
